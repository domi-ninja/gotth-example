## Golang Tailwind Templ Htmx Sqlc

The whole fun of doing full-stack go is cooking your own stack. There are some like it, but this one is mine. 

## Reasoning for technolgies used

- Tailwind: I am fine with using plain CSS with variables, but prefer tailwind. As a bonus, this allows me to use things like https://daisyui.com/htmx-component-library/. It also makes it so that ai-generated styles are less likely to break existing styles in other places (not local to the component).
- [Templ](https://templ.guide/): Inspired by [pocketbase](https://pocketbase.io/), I have tried using a thin wrapper around [`html/template`](https://pkg.go.dev/html/template) for server side rendering. It worked *fine*, but similar to tailwind, I have concluded that it is worth using. In this case, the slight annoyances are worth it to recieve some compile-time type safety for the templates, and for being able to use the database models generated by sqlc directly in my templates
- [HTMX](https://htmx.org/) is one of the many fun ways to make the server side rendered pages come to life. I am very familiar with it, but there is many other mini-frameworks that would do the same jobs just as well
- [SQLC](https://github.com/sqlc-dev/sqlc): SQLC is used for generating models and functions for interacting with a relational DB. It occupies a sweet spot between an ORM and having to write your own DB interfaces with a bunch of copy-pasting, and I feel very good about using this.
